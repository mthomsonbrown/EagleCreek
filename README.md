# EagleCreek

EagleCreek is a menu-based real-time farming simulator.

## Motivation

This application is an opportunity for me to get familiar with the MEAN web stack. I know the concept sounds pretty out there, but I think this is just something that needs to exist in the world.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
Before running the tests make sure you are serving the app via `ng serve`.
